r4in Boilerplate is a frontend template I just made up based on the [HTML5 Boiletplate](https://html5boilerplate.com), [Travis Neilson's DevTips StarterKit](https://github.com/DevTips/DevTips-Starter-Kit) packed with [Zell Liew's Gulp](http://zellwk.com/blog/gulp-tutorial/) goodness. 

This is just something that currently fits in my current workflow & process when I want to build a really simple site. So feel free to fork or improve this repo by shooting a pull request! :)

* Source: [https://github.com/r4in/](https://github.com/r4in/)


## Quick start

How To Use:

1. Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
   https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate.git`

2. Fire up the terminal and hit 'npm install' to get all node package dependencies.

2. All source files are the the app folder. This will be your workspace and to begin, open the terminal and `gulp watch` to activate sass & livereload.

3. To prepare your code for deployment, run `gulp build` to export everything to the dist folder. This will automatically run npm modules like combining all your js & css files into one file.
